-> For using the materialize, go to get started - then CDN - put both links provided in the code.... moreover, it also needs jQuery as a dependency.  Remember to add jQuery before materialize & fontawesome cdn after materialize. And index.js file at the end..... JUST DOING THIS WILL MAKE THE WORK A LOT SIMPLER AND IT REMOVED THE CSS WORK.
