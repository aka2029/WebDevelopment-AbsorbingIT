-> you can do pretty much everything that you do in your js file from within your console.. it goes on refreshing and should be used for testing purposes.
-> For using the materialize, go to get started - then CDN - put both links provided in the code.... moreover, it also needs jQuery as a dependency.  Remember to add jQuery before materialize & fontawesome cdn after materialize. And index.js file at the end..... JUST DOING THIS WILL MAKE THE WORK A LOT SIMPLER AND IT REMOVED THE CSS WORK.
-> in Task List project, while deleting we have to delete multiple of them and they are dynamic so we have to use EVENT DELEGATION.

READING RESOURCES SUGGESTED:
: To know the difference between the innerHTML and remove child "https://jsperf.com/innerhtml-vs-removechild/47" (Mainly recommended for Task list project)
: know the difference between event delegation and event bubbling

LINKS:
: using materialize in projects, just use the link on -> materializecss.com [Project: Task List]
: using bootstrap in projects, just use the getting starter link on -> getbootstrap.com [Project: Loan Calculator]
: using skeleton cdn in projects, just use the lind on skeleton.com [Project Number Gusser]

THINGS THAT NEED A LOT OF MY ATTENTION:
1. e i.e event tag
2. JSON parsing & stringify when storing it in local storage
3. nodelist and array and string usage and when to convert
4. difference between mousedown, mouseup, click, etc etc
