$$ Remember that dist is the final project, if something has to be shown or take this is the stuff not the rest (see vid:112 again)

$$ if you dont want to go through this hassle then download Koala[It is a graphical interface] and it will do all this work that we did in terminal
(prefer terminal)

$$ There also another way, just download an extension in vscode by the name "live sass compiler" ... it will compile sass for you 

$$ Before using this sass project in terminal "npm run sass" and select the perticular folder & parent folder(like WebDev-Absorbing it)

$$ Using underscore in this file naming tells the compiler that we don't want this file to get compiles and we dont want variable.css in our css folder
& While importing the file just write "@import 'variables';" on top of the main.scss file ... see that we haven't included the _ or .scss extension.

$$ after creating every new file in scss , re-run sass from the terminal
