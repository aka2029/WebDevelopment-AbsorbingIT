$$ Remember that dist is the final project, if something has to be shown or take this is the stuff not the rest (see vid:112 again)

$$ if you dont want to go through this hassle then download Koala[It is a graphical interface] and it will do all this work that we did in terminal
(prefer terminal)

$$ There also another way, just download an extension in vscode by the name "live sass compiler" ... it will compile sass for you
