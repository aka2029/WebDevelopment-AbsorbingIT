-> the first layout that we create is known as boiler plate
-> Photoshop is also important
-> for ideas and inspiration look for themes online
-> pixels are 1/96th of an inch
-> default text size is 16px & by default links are inline so, use inline-block
-> use png files for images with no background
-> the properties that are further down will overlap the properties that are up in style.
-> we can't do margin: auto on inline elements, it has to be block element
-> positioning is not used much now, because responsiveness and looking good on mobile devices is very important and when things done in this way is not very mobile friendly
-> understand overflow property in css more indepth. source: "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/overflow"
-> use chrome dev tools to find pixels no. on various smartphones and tablets
and check how it looks on other devices
-> Em is a multiplyer of font size of its parent element, and Rem unit is relative to the font size of root html element
-> vh, vw is veiwport height and veiwport width.... veiwport is the browser area... 50 vh is going ot take up 50 of 100 veiwport heights
-> all browsers of any height has 100 veiwport slices
-> Earlier jQuery was required for many things but now mostly everything can be easily done by JS. However, animation is something that is difficult to do in some situations. so things like sliders and scrolling effect- jQuery makes stuff really easy.
-> LINUX reles the hosting world, the servers runs on it.(The best for me is static hosting(Netlify, github pages, etc), shared hosting and cloud hosting)
-> While using ::befor or ::after, the content attribute has to be used
-> h1.a,  (here a is anchor tag)This is looking different because till now to represent a specific tag we have just used classes or id's but for the first time we have used a tag and a class
-> to create a variable "--name"
-> any variable you create in the root scope can be used anywhere in the style sheet
-> if we put the style sheet link before the menu link in the index.html, then.. we can use the variables of the style.css in the menu.css 

-> learn about all CSS Selectors LINK: "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Selectors"
-> Look closely - "font: normal 1rem/1.5 'Arial', sans-serif"

-> we should always add JavaScript files at the end of the index page.
-> some professional fonts are = Roboto, Staatliches, Lato, Dosis
-> small tag is a inline element that will basically make the elements small

ALL ABOUT SASS:
-To know npm version -> npm --version
-To create package.json file, we added -y so we dont have to ans bunch of questions and it will give the default -> npm init -y Or dont put -y and hit enter in all the questions but in description write the project name.
-Now, we want to install node sass -> npm install node-sass -D (by D we are using it as a dev dependency).
-Now, in the package.json file change test to sass so we can do npm run sass and also change within ""
-Then after doing the code in scss folder(main.scss) do "npm run sass" and this will automatically create a css folder in dist...after this no need to touch the css folder just go on with the scss folder.
-Files in scss with name starting with _ (eg _config.scss) do not get compiled and are automatically added if we put (@import 'config';) at the top of the main.scss file
-Eg. to create a base shared class for all buttons do like this

                              %btn-shared { // This is a base shared button style so all btns will share this style }

                              .btn {
                                &-main {
                                  @extend %btn-shared;
                                  color: #333;  }
                                &-light {
                                  @extend %btn-shared;
                                  color: #333;  }
                              }
